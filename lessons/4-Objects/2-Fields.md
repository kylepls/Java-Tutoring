What makes up a Bob?
Age and IQ are a good start. 

Age = integer
IQ = integer

Lets add them as data to our object.

Syntax:
    
    <access modifier> <type> <name> = <value>;

Example:
    
    class Bob {
        int age = 10;
        int iq = 70;
    }

Can be accessed through entire class now :)
    
    class Bob {
       int age = 10;
       int iq = 69;
      
       int ageAndIq = age + iq;
    }

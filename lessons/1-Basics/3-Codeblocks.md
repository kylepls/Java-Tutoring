 A block of code is a set of instructions (statements) that will always be run together. In Java these are defined with an opening and closing brace {}

It is conventional to indent the content inside a code block by 4 spaces. Some editors allow you to just use tab to insert 4 spaces.

Example: 
{
	Stuff
}

The opening brace starts the block and the closing brace ends the block.
The keyword class must be followed by a name and then a block to define the content of the class. Like so:

**<span style="color:blue">class</span>** <name> {
// stuff
}

**<span style="color:blue">class</span>** Name {}

It is common practice to name your classes using Camel case Notation. 
Camel case Notation is when the first letter of every word in the name is capital.

So look at the following examples:

| Desired Name | Camel Case Name |
| :---: | :---: |
| grilled porkchop | GrilledPorkchop |
|A potato with grilled onions covered in sour cream | PotatoWithGrilledOnionsCoveredInSourCream |

Now we can create our first class. Remember a class is the design of an object.

**<span style="color:blue">class</span>** Vegetable {
	Do things
}

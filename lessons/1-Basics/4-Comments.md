Comments are a way of adding notes to our code. It is important to make sure that other people can understand your reasoning behind a problem, so adding notes will make their day a little less awful.

For now, a comment in Java can be added by adding a prefix of ‘//’ to the statement.

So to add the comment “do things” to the class Vegetable, we would do the following

**<span style="color:blue">class</span>** Vegetable {
	// do things
}

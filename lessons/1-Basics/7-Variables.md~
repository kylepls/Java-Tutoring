Variables allow us to remember things. Yeah.
You can declare a variable by declaring the type and then the name. The name will be how you reference the variable in your code. (Like a street name)

When you create a variable it is called variable declaration. 

Syntax:

    <type> <name>

Example:

    int aNumber

    boolean aBoolean

Variable Assignment
We can assign a value to a variable by using the assignment operator “=”
Variable assignment follows this syntax:

	<variable name> = <value>

Examples:

    aNumber = 23

    aBoolean = false

We can also assign values to variables when we create them. This follows the following syntax:

    <type> <name> = <value>
Examples:

    int aNumber = -12

    boolean aBoolean = true

Variables as a statement
All of the examples given in this section do not work. We did not tell Java that we finished our statements. We should fix that:

    int aNumber 
    boolean aBoolean
    
becomes ->        
        
    int aNumber;
    boolean aBoolean;


All of these are now valid statements.

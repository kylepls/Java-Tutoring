#### Basics
Used to represent text in Java
Syntax:
    
    "text"
    
Example:

    System.out.println("Hello!");

#### Escaping Characters
If you needed to print out "Kyle is cool" - Zach to console you would type it like this:

    ""Kyle is cool" - Zach"

The problem is that Java thinks we are creating 2 separate strings. 
One is "" and the other is " - Zach".
This code will not compile.

To fix this, lets tell Java to ignore the new quotes.
You can ignore quotes by escaping them.

Syntax:
    \"

Example:
    "\"Kyle is cool\" - Zach"

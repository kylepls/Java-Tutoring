A class is the schematic for an object. It defines how an object will be created and used. (So it would be like the plans of a building)

An object is going to be an instance (occurrence of) a class. (So it would be the finished building)

Object oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects as the primary building block for everything else. (This will be important later)

In Java, classes are defined using the keyword **<span style="color:blue">class</span>**.
